# Gmod-taunt-hook-checker
So basically if the *act dance* stuff won't work even enabled in the settings, this little serversided script allows you to check for all [PlayerShouldTaunt](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PlayerShouldTaunt) hooks on your server.
It checks in addons, lua/autorun and gamemodes. It won't check Workshop addons.

> *Keep in mind: change only something in a gamemode if you know what you're doing!*
